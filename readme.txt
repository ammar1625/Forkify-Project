the project idea was inspired from jonas schmedtmann javascript course which is in the link bellow

https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/ 

but it was all made by me from scratch (html elements-css styles-javascript scripts)
i made it as a chalenge

NOTE!!!
whenever you try it out try to evade sending too much requests (too much searches) because this is gonna make the server slow due to server's issue not my application's performance problems :-)
